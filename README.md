Why should I use Git?
There are many advantages to using Git in programming today, regardless of programming.

Git easy to use, safe and fast.
Can help group code work process much simpler by combining branches (branch).
You can work anywhere because you just need to clone the source code from the repository or clone a modified version from the repository, or a branch from the repository.
Easy to deploy products.
And more.
If you're a programmer, Git is a system you need to know how to use, at least for now
